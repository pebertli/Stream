Create 2 C++ console applications, one will be the client and the other one, the server.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows
Use Cereal library for serialization
Use the overlapped instead of multithread, overhead, share data between clients
All the requirements were developed
The Client can: 
Execute the server or client in any order
Try with multiple clients
read operation is async but the listening it self is not. For example, 

The 8 hours wasn't enough to check things as:
- check atomic instructions
- send the desired proceure to be call on server
- Check duplicated servers
- a simple polymorphism in square and circle



Well as i said before i try to include that class into a gui framework called Qxt. So i don't know how much pipes a possible user wants to create.

If i use threading every pipe and every new instance of the pipe would need a own thread. So there is really the question if using a thread for every pipe is not a bit heavy for windows. Well opening to many pipes would be too heavy too...
I implemented a testcase where it was possible to do what i want without threads so i think i will use the overlapped i/o way.
Every connected instance of a pipe will use two events one event to monitor that new data is availabe and one that indicates a overlapped write is finished. Its absolutely okay to have a pending read when starting a write to the pipe. I tested it and it worked perfectly. So there is a pending read all the time waiting for new data.

I love this chalenge and, again, thank you for the opportunity
